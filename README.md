# EDU-Tech
Edu-tech is intended to be a web learning resource that is geared towards helping grade 6 students help pass their EQAO math examinations. This tool is designed to help teachers monitor their students and see the overall class stats of who passed their last tests and who failed. 
	
## Feature:
Take a quiz:  In order to test your readiness to take the EQAO, why not practice real EQAO questions? After taking the quiz, you will be taken to your personalized results page which will give you a breakdown of your strong and weak areas, as well as videos that will teach you skills for the problems you were unable to solve. You can take up to 5 unique quizzes, allowing you chart your improvement over time. For best results: watch the videos to bolster your skills before taking the next quiz!

View your results: Once you have taken at least one quiz, you can always see your progress, by looking at your personalized results page. Here, you will find graphs that chart your progress over time, as well as any persistent trouble areas.

Access resources: At any time, you can also access the resources page in order to view videos that teach the particular grade 6 skills that EQAO tests. Feel free to look at these resources before taking your first quiz!
